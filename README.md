### First Web Programming Assignment  (HTML Static Web App)

This basic-static HTML web app was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS (this one to apply a typing effect in a principal header title) as part of my first web programming appointment. To see the webpage running, you should click [here](https://personal-webpage-assigment-one.herokuapp.com/) to see a previsualization.

### Disclaimer ⚠
This project is deployed using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and PHP. Why? Foremost, Heroku has a free-not-cost deployment of at least 5 personal projects, so it’s useful for this kind of assignment. However, Heroku does not permit the deployment of static web pages using HTML, so using the following PHP snippet of code ```<?php include_once("index.html");?>``` in an ```index.php``` to include it the corresponding HTML file.
